# DATA OPERATIONS THAT WERE PERFORMED ON THE DATA SET TO PRODUCE THE OUTPUT
## Step_1
1. Initially the Test and Training data sets were read into the R workspace using read.table
2. Column binding operations were performed using cbind to create a single data frame for test and training data values.

## Step_2 (MERGE OF TRAINING & TEST SETS TO CREATE A COMPLETE DATA SET
1. Training and Test data sets were merged to create one complete data set using rbind.
- Complete_Data: Single data frame consisting of training and test data sets.

## Step_3 (EXTRACT ONLY THE MEASUREMENTS ON THE MEAN & STANDARD DEVIATION FOR EACH MEASUREMENT)
*REQUIRED PACKAGE: dplyr
1. To complete this, I used the concept of grep command to extract the index values related to the mean & standard deviation measurements of the feature variables stored in the workspace.
- Mean: numeric vector containing the index values of mean ().
- Std: numeric vector containing the index values of std ().
2. A temporary variable was created to store only the training and test feature values (exception is application to the column values of Window_samples and Activity_labels) of the merged data set
- Window_samples: Contains the subject values for each window samples ranging from 1 to 30.
- Activity _labels: labels for the activities performed during the experiment.
- Temp_Data: Consists of training and test feature data values.
3. Using the derived index values measurements on the mean and standard deviation were extracted and merged with the column values of Window_samples and Activity_labels.
- Complete_Data: Contains the extracted data set 

## Step_4 (USE DECRIPTIVE ACTIVITY LABELS TO NAME THE ACTIVITIES IN THE DATA SET)
1. Made use of loop condition to match the values mentioned in the Activity_labels and name the activities appropriately.

## Step_5 (LABEL THE DECRIPTIVE VARIABLE NAMES)
1. grep command was used to label the descriptive variable names.
-Complete_Data: Contains the tidy data set
#From my perspective I think I have tried my level best to produce the tidy data because
- Each variable is in one column.
- Each different observation of that variable is in a different row.
- One table for each kind of variable.

## Step_6 (INDEPENDENT TIDY DATA SET WITH THE AVERAGE OF EACH VARIABLE FOR EACH ACTIVITY AND SUBJECT)
*REQUIRED PACKAGE: reshape2, plyr
1. Firstly, Tidy data set was melted to create a molten data frame to calculate the average.
- Tidy_Data: Molten data set.
2. Concept of casting in R was used to determine the average of each variable for each activity and subject separately.
- Activity_avg: Contains the average of each feature variable for each activity.
- Subject_avg: Contains the average of each feature variable for each subject.
- Output_Data: Single Independent data set with the average of each feature variable for each activity and each subject.
